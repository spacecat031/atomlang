# loops

loops are used to do an action over and over again

## how to use loops

to create a loop that repeatedly says "hello world" you need to type the following.

<pre>loop
print("hello world")
loop.begin //closes the loop so the code below isnt included
</pre>

this works with any other type of code

funfact:loops can be used inside if conditions
for example:
<pre>if 5 ?= 4
loop
print("its NOT equal!")
loop.begin
if.end //closes the if conditions so code below doesnt get included
</pre>
