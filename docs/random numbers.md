# random numbers <sub>added in 2025.1</sub>

ever wanted to make a random number in a range? no? me neither but i have to make this doc interesting:

### replace min and max with the minimum of the random number and the maxmum for example 5 - 8
<pre>num.random(min - max)</pre>

now this wouldnt work because you have to put it in something like a variabler or a print function. something like

<pre>print(num.random(5 - 9))</pre>

<sub>note:make sure that its not in ""</sub>

or 

<pre>var myvar = num.random(5 - 10)</pre>

to learn to print a variable visit the [✨Variables✨ Documentation](https://github.com/spacecat031/atomlang/blob/main/docs/%E2%9C%A8variables%E2%9C%A8.md)
